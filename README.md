and modified for the Cloud by Professor Nancy Um of Art History and the Harpur 
Dean's Office, Binghamton University, to aid in the conversion of SOOT 
(Student Opinion of Teaching) data into an aggregated format.

In order to use this script, you must upload your own data. Navigate to the #
SOOT surveys page in `myBinghamton`, which can be found under the
